              I enjoy creating websites and applications that offer a great user
              experience. In the vast world of Front-end, I particularly see the
              importance of coding with accessibility in mind, providing a good
              user experience for all.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.textAbout}>
              While I'm focused on Front-End, I also want to understand the big
              picture. I see IT as a big puzzle without borders. Therefore, I
              build my own puzzle, piece by piece, gaining insights into
              backend, deployment, cloud, testing, UI Design... Learning this
              helps me see the full project.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.textAbout}>
              The funny thing about IT is that each one of us builds their own
              puzzle, spreading the knowledge between team members, making
              teamwork and communication crucial. I'm a team player, and love
              watching a product grow through team collaborations!

            I was born and raised in a small village in Brittany, France, (which
            may be located near Asterix and Obelix's village). I have always
            been fascinated by other cultures and languages, which led me to
            seize an opportunity to move to the Netherlands almost 10 years ago.

            In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, or

            One thing you won't catch me doing is jumping from a plane with a
            parachute (or jumping from heights, in general). However, I do hope
            to achieve one of my aspirations, which is to learn to sing in tune
            one day.
