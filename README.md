<h1 align="center">Portfolio</h1>

This is my second attempt at creating a portfolio for my project. While I made one last December, I wasn't satisfied with the design and never ended up using it.

This time around, I made sure to prioritize the visual aspect of the portfolio. I didn't compromise on anything, from ensuring responsiveness to carefully selecting the color palette, and I'm pleased with the results.

I also took the opportunity to start using the conventionnal commit messages.
