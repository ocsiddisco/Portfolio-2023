<h1 align="center">Portfolio</h1>

The actuel website is my third portfolio. I built my second portfolio last summer (Called V2, you can take a look at it on the gif below), and it was not to my taste anymore. Therefore, I decided to give it an upgrade. I found it quite satisfying to dive back into the code, implement new learnings, and correct a few things along the way!


## Commands

### Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Run development server

```
npm run dev
```
